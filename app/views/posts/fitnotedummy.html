      <p class="font-medium">This space has been created for people working within Health and Disability as a platform to share our success, knowledge share and continue to strengthen our fast growing community.</p>

      <p>Over the last few months I have identified that we have some fantastic things going on that we really need to be shouting about. There’s also a lot of ‘things’ that we need to be better at sharing with each other.</p>

      <img src="https://www.xactplacements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cheer-welcome-still.jpg" class="blog_image" />

      <p>Working with you, I want to provide you with that voice with the aim of creating some real transparency across all sites and I want to make this process as easy as possible but I can not do it without your help.</p>

      <p>Absolutely be proud of your success, share your stories and be heard, as I promise there is someone sat on another team who either have the answer or have the same problem.</p>

      <p>I look forward to speaking with you soon. </p>

      <p>The Health and Disabilty Comms team</p>
