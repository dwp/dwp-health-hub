          <li>Customer Information System (CSI) discussions with CIS product owners continue in attempt to gain agreement for a single Health System ID and
            persistence of Customer data within the Health platform. This is to avoid heavy costs and lead times associated with on boarding individual
            products/benefit lines and allow us to share and manage our health data more effectively (with regular refresh and batch notifications from CIS)</li>

          <li>Simple Queuing Service and Simple Notification Service to replace Rabbit MQ federated broker pattern currently being worked through by Narender and
            Chris Hulley. This will improve the reliability and maintenance involved in managing health messaging/events</li>
          <li>Elastic Container Service (ECS) proof of concept being worked through by Lewis and Narender who is pulling to together a Design Authority submission.
